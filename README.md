Welcome to Star Adventures, an exciting and challenging game where your goal is to collect stars while avoiding obstacles! The game features simple mechanics and a progressive challenge system, offering increasing difficulty and rewards as you play.

Objective:
In Star Adventures, you control a player represented by the üåê emoji, and your objective is to collect stars while navigating around obstacles. Each time you collect a star, you earn points, and your challenge is to collect a certain number of stars in each level.

How to Play:
Player Movement: Use the W, A, S, D keys to move your player around the canvas. You can move up, down, left, and right to collect stars and avoid obstacles.
Stars: The stars are represented by the ‚≠ê emoji. As you collect these stars, you earn points. However, there are challenges where you need to collect a specific number of stars to advance.
Obstacles: The obstacles are represented by the üí£ emoji, and they can be deadly. If you collide with an obstacle, the game will reset, and you will have to start over. The number of obstacles increases as you progress through the challenges.
Challenges: Each challenge requires you to collect a set number of stars. As you complete each challenge, you move on to the next, with the difficulty increasing (more obstacles, higher star requirements).
Tokens: You earn tokens by completing challenges. Tokens can be used to purchase upgrades to make your player bigger, which may help in avoiding obstacles.

Features:
Emoji-based Art: The game uses emojis to represent the player, stars, and obstacles, making it visually unique and fun.
Progressive Difficulty: The game includes a dynamic challenge system where the difficulty increases as you collect more stars, and the number of obstacles also grows.
Upgrades: You can purchase upgrades using tokens, such as increasing the size of your player to help with navigation and avoiding obstacles.
